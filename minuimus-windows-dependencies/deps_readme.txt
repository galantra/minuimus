These are most of the dependencies and supporting utilities to run minuimus.pl on windows, compiled and ready to use. All of them are under some form of open-source licence with the exception of pngout.

Pngout is is written by programming legend Ken Silverman, who really ought to update and release some of his ancient utilities - he permits redistribution of these compiled binaries, but never released source. Seriously Mr Silverman, I don't know how you did it, but your DEFLATE implimentation is miraculous and a lot more people would benefit if you released the source. Gimme.
